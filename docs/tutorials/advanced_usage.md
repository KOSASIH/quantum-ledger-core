# Advanced Usage of Quantum Ledger

## Introduction
This tutorial covers advanced features and functionalities of the Quantum Ledger system. You will learn how to utilize smart contracts, handle multiple transactions, and implement error handling.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have completed the **Getting Started** tutorial and have a basic understanding of the Quantum Ledger API.

## Step 1: Working with Smart Contracts
Quantum Ledger supports smart contracts, allowing you to automate transactions based on predefined conditions. Here’s how to deploy a simple smart contract:

### Deploying a Smart Contract
```python
1 from quantum_ledger_core import deploy_smart_contract
2 
3 contract_code = """
4 pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
5 
6 contract SimpleStorage {
7     uint256 storedData;
8 
9     function set(uint256 x) public {
10        storedData = x;
11    }
12 
13     function get() public view returns (uint256) {
14         return storedData;
15     }
16 }
17 """
18 
19 contract_address = deploy_smart_contract(contract_code)
20 print(f"Smart Contract Deployed at: {contract_address}")
```

## Step 2: Handling Multiple Transactions
You can create and manage multiple transactions in a single script. Here’s an example:

```python
1 transactions = [
2     {"from": "0x1234567890abcdef", "to": "0xfedcba9876543210", "amount": 5.0, "currency": "QLD"},
3     {"from": "0x1234567890abcdef", "to": "0xabcdef1234567890", "amount": 10.0, "currency": "QLD"},
4 ]
5 
6 for tx in transactions:
7     transaction = create_transaction(**tx)
8     print(f"Transaction ID: {transaction.transaction_id}")
```

Step 3: Implementing Error Handling
When working with APIs, it’s essential to handle errors gracefully. Here’s how to implement basic error handling:

```python
1 try:
2     transaction = create_transaction(
3         from_address="0x1234567890abcdef",
4         to_address="0xfedcba9876543210",
5         amount=10.0,
6         currency="QLD"
7     )
8     print(f"Transaction ID: {transaction.transaction_id}")
9 except Exception as e:
10    print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
```

# Conclusion

You have now explored advanced features of the Quantum Ledger system, including smart contracts, handling multiple transactions, and implementing error handling. For further information and examples, refer to the API documentation and user guide.
