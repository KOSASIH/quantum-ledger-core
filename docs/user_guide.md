2 cd quantum-ledger-core pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setting Up the Environment
Create a new file named config.py with the following content:

```python
1 API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
2 NODE_URL = "https://api.quantum-ledger-core.com/v1"
3 Using the Quantum Ledger API
```

## Creating a Transaction
To create a new transaction, use the create_transaction function:

```python
1 from quantum_ledger_core import create_transaction
2 
3 tx = create_transaction(
4     from_address="0x1234567890abcdef",
5     to_address="0xfedcba9876543210",
6     amount=10.0,
7     currency="QLD",
8     metadata={"message": "Hello, Quantum Ledger!"}
9 )
10 
11 print(tx.transaction_id)
```

## Retrieving Transaction Status
To retrieve the status of a specific transaction, use the get_transaction_status function:

```python
1 from quantum_ledger_core import get_transaction_status
2 
3 tx_status = get_transaction_status(transaction_id="0x1234567890abcdef")
4 print(tx_status.status)
```

## Exploring the Ledger State
To retrieve the current state of the ledger, use the get_ledger_state function:

```python
1 from quantum_ledger_core import get_ledger_state
2 
3 ledger_state = get_ledger_state()
4 print(ledger_state)
```
